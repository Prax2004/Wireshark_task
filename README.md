### Objective
To capture live network traffic and analyze basic protocols using Wireshark.

### Tool Used
Wireshark

### Steps Performed
1. Started packet capture on the active network interface.
2. Generated traffic by browsing websites and performing DNS queries.
3. Stopped the capture after one minute.
4. Filtered packets by protocol.
5. Exported the capture as a .pcap file.

### Protocols Identified
- DNS: Used for domain name resolution.
- TCP: Reliable transport protocol.
- TLS: Encrypted HTTPS web traffic.

### Conclusion
Wireshark enables real-time packet capture and protocol analysis, helping understand network communication.
